The following is a remake of the great work done by Minute Physics.
They get credit for the idea and original work. Please visit the
[Big Bang Registry](http://www.bigbangregistry.com/) to see it and donate to help them keep doing what
they do best.

This version is a cleaner implementation using the google maps API,
and RequireJS for asynchronous JS loading and dependency management.

This version is done by Jasper Palfree [wellcaffeinated.net](http://wellcaffeinated.net).
